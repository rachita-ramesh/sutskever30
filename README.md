   cd sutskever30
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up OpenAI API**
   ```bash
   echo 'OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here' > .env.local
   ```

3. **Run development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in browser**
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 📖 Available Concepts

Our AI tutor can teach you about:

**Foundational (Beginner)**
- Backpropagation - The fundamental training algorithm
- Convolutional Neural Networks - Image understanding
- Dropout - Preventing overfitting
- Adam Optimizer - Adaptive learning
- Word2Vec - Word representations

**Intermediate**
- Attention Mechanisms - Focus and relevance
- Residual Learning - Skip connections
- LSTM - Long-term memory
- Batch Normalization - Training acceleration

**Advanced**
- Generative Adversarial Networks - Competing networks
- Variational Autoencoders - Probabilistic generation
- BERT - Bidirectional language understanding

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Inspired by Vercel's design system:
- **Minimalist**: Clean, distraction-free interface
- **Modern**: Subtle gradients, perfect typography, smooth interactions
- **Accessible**: High contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader friendly
- **Fast**: Optimized performance with Next.js

## 🤖 How It Works

1. **Choose Your Topic**: Pick from two randomly suggested concepts
2. **Start Conversation**: AI introduces the concept engagingly
3. **Ask Questions**: Dive deeper, request examples, explore edge cases
4. **Switch Anytime**: Change topics mid-conversation if curious about something else

The AI tutor:
- Explains concepts conversationally, not academically
- Uses analogies and real-world examples
- Adapts to your responses and questions
- References original papers when relevant
- Encourages exploration and curiosity
