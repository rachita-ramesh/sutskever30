Product Specification: Sutskever30 Learning Platform
Context
Ilya Sutskever famously shared a curated reading list with John Carmack, containing foundational and cutting-edge papers in ML/AI. These papers are often dense, technical, and inaccessible to learners at different levels. Our platform bridges this gap by making complex research papers comprehensible to anyone, regardless of their background.
Vision
Primary Goal: Transform dense academic papers into accessible learning resources that anyone can understand at their own level.
Core Principle: Accessibility over completion. Users should be able to deeply understand any individual paper, not necessarily progress through all papers.
User Personas
1. Curious Beginner
Heard about AI concepts, wants to understand the fundamentals
Needs intuitive explanations and visual aids
May not have strong math/CS background
2. Intermediate Learner
Has some ML knowledge, wants to understand specific techniques
Comfortable with basic math, needs concept bridges
Looking to deepen understanding of particular areas
3. Technical Implementer
Experienced developer/researcher
Needs technical details, proofs, implementation guidance
Wants to build on or reference the work
User Flow
Primary Journey: "I want to understand [specific paper]"

1. Discover Paper
   ├── Search by topic/technique
   ├── Browse paper grid
   └── Direct link/reference

2. Choose Understanding Level
   ├── "Explain the big idea" (Visual/intuitive)
   ├── "Show me how it works" (Conceptual/mathematical)
   └── "I want to build this" (Technical/implementation)

3. Learn at Chosen Level
   ├── Switch between levels anytime
   ├── Access related context when needed
   └── Use interactive elements/demos

4. Optional: Explore Related Concepts
   ├── Referenced papers (context, not sequence)
   ├── Related techniques
   └── Implementation resources

Core Features
1. Multi-Level Paper Explanations
a. Intuitive Level: Plain English, analogies, visual diagrams

3. Interactive Elements: Build demos/visualizations where helpful
4. Cross-Reference: Link to related concepts
5. Review: Ensure accessibility across all levels

Success Metrics
Primary Metrics
a. Comprehension: Users can explain concepts after reading
b. Engagement: Time spent on individual papers
c. Accessibility: Usage across different skill levels

Secondary Metrics
a. Discovery: How users find papers
b. Level Usage: Distribution across difficulty levels
d. Cross-References: Usage of related paper links
